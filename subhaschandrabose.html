      <h2>About Subhas Chandra Bose</h2>
      <p>
        Subhas Chandra Bose (1897–1945) was a prominent Indian nationalist
        leader who fought for India’s independence with unmatched courage and
        vision. He believed that freedom could not be achieved by non-violence
        alone and took bold steps toward armed struggle.
      </p>
      <p>
        He led the **Indian National Army (INA)** and coined the slogan **“Give me
        blood, and I will give you freedom.”** His efforts to seek international
        support and his alliance with Axis powers during World War II marked a
        radical phase in the independence movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though his death remains a mystery, Bose is remembered as **“Netaji”** — a
        title of honor for his fearless leadership and sacrifice for India’s
        independence.

      <h3>A Leader is Born</h3>
      <p>
        In the bustling town of Cuttack in Odisha, on **23 January 1897**, a child
        was born to Janakinath Bose and Prabhavati Devi. (A Leader is Born)
        Raised in a large, affectionate Bengali family, young Subhash absorbed
        the values of self-respect, duty, and love for the motherland. His
        father was a respected lawyer, and his mother’s gentle strength shaped
        his sense of compassion and discipline.
      </p>

      <h3>A Brilliant Student with a Patriotic Heart</h3>
      <p>
        As he grew, Subhash showed a sharp mind and a quiet determination. (A
        Brilliant Student with a Patriotic Heart) At Ravenshaw Collegiate School
        and later at Presidency College in Calcutta, he excelled in studies but
        never accepted injustice. An incident of British professor-student
        conflict at Presidency disturbed him deeply, and he began to see
        education as more than grades—it was a path to serve India.
      </p>

      <h3>Choosing the Nation Over a Secure Career</h3>
      <p>
        After graduating, he traveled to England to prepare for the **Indian Civil
        Service (ICS) examination** and succeeded with high merit. (Choosing the
        Nation Over a Secure Career) Yet his conscience tugged at him. Serving a
        colonial government did not match his ideals. He **resigned** before taking
        up the post—an uncommon and courageous step—declaring that his real duty
        was to fight for India’s freedom.
      </p>

      <h3>Learning Leadership</h3>
      <p>
        Returning to India in the early 1920s, Subhash plunged into the freedom
        movement under the influence of Swami Vivekananda’s teachings and the
        call of Mahatma Gandhi’s mass politics. (Learning Leadership) He
        organized students, wrote passionately for newspapers, and earned a
        reputation for tireless work, discipline, and a fearless voice against
        oppression.
      </p>

      <h3>Rising to National Leadership</h3>
      <p>
        His abilities soon brought him to the front ranks of the Indian National
        Congress. (Rising to National Leadership) Elected Mayor of Calcutta and
        later Congress President at Haripura in 1938 and again in 1939, Bose
        argued for complete independence and rapid industrialization.
        Differences with senior leaders on the pace and method of struggle led
        him to step down and form the **Forward Bloc**, a platform to unite all
        anti-colonial forces.
      </p>

      <h3>The Great Escape</h3>
      <p>
        British authorities repeatedly imprisoned him, hoping to silence his
        influence. (The Great Escape) In **1941**, while under house arrest in
        Calcutta, he slipped away in disguise, traveled north by train and road
        through Peshawar and Kabul, and reached Europe. His journey was daring
        and dangerous, driven by a single aim—to find international allies to
        free India.
      </p>

      <h3>Azad Hind in Europe</h3>
      <p>
        In Germany, Bose set up the Free India Centre and raised the **Indian
        Legion** from prisoners of war. (Azad Hind in Europe) He broadcast
        stirring messages to Indians, calling for unity beyond region, religion,
        or caste. Yet, as the tides of the war shifted, he looked eastward to
        where a larger Indian force could be organized.
      </p>

      <h3>To the East for Freedom</h3>
      <p>
        Undaunted by risk, Bose crossed oceans during wartime, transferring
        between submarines in a remarkable voyage to reach East Asia. (To the
        East for Freedom) In 1943 he arrived in Japanese-held territory, where
        thousands of Indian soldiers and civilians awaited a leader who matched
        their hope with action.
      </p>

      <h3>The Birth of Azad Hind</h3>
      <p>
        Taking command of the **Indian National Army (INA)**, he reorganized it with
        strict discipline and a clear goal—march to Delhi. (The Birth of Azad
        Hind) On **21 October 1943**, he proclaimed the Provisional Government of
        Azad Hind in Singapore, adopted **‘Jai Hind’** as a unifying salutation,
        rallied the nation with ‘Give me blood, and I will give you freedom,’
        and set up the **Rani of Jhansi Regiment**, a pioneering all-women combat
        unit.
      </p>

      <h3>Delhi Chalo</h3>
      <p>
        In 1944, INA units fought alongside Japanese forces toward India’s
        eastern frontiers. (Delhi Chalo) The INA flag was raised at **Moirang in
        Manipur**, symbolizing the nearness of the dream. But the fierce battles
        of Imphal and Kohima, monsoon, disease, and supply shortages turned the
        tide. The INA retreated with courage intact but resources spent.
      </p>

      <h3>A Spark That Lit Millions</h3>
      <p>
        Though battlefield victory eluded them, the INA’s story shook British
        confidence. (A Spark That Lit Millions) The Red Fort trials of INA
        officers stirred unprecedented public sympathy across India—Hindus,
        Muslims, Sikhs, and others rallied together. The idea that Indian
        soldiers had fought under an Indian banner electrified the country and
        weakened colonial authority from within.
      </p>

      <h3>The Unfinished Journey</h3>
      <p>
        In August 1945, as the war neared its end, news spread that Netaji
        Subhash Chandra Bose had died in an **air crash in Taiwan on 18 August**.
        (The Unfinished Journey) Questions about the circumstances remained, and
        debates would continue for decades. Yet, beyond the mystery stood a
        clear truth—his life had become a symbol of fearless action for freedom.
      </p>

      <h3>Legacy of a Hero</h3>
      <p>
        Today, Subhash Chandra Bose’s name evokes courage, sacrifice, and
        purposeful leadership. (Legacy of a Hero) He taught that freedom demands
        unity, discipline, and readiness to give one’s all. His call—**‘Jai
        Hind’**—still rings as a national salute, reminding every generation that
        love for the motherland is shown not only in words but in determined
        deeds.
