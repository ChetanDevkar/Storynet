     <h3>The Loudest Voice in the Jungle</h3>
<p>Percy was a beautiful, emerald-green parrot who loved to talk. Unfortunately, Percy did not know the meaning of "inside voice." From the moment the sun rose, Percy's day was one continuous, loud party. "HELLO! HELLO! WAKE UP, EVERYONE!" he would screech at top volume. He loved to imitate the roaring lion, the honking elephant, and even the screeching brakes of the bus that passed the jungle border twice a day. The problem was, all the other animals—especially sleepy old Barnaby the Bear—wished Percy would just be quiet.</p>

<h3>A Terrible Headache</h3>
<p>One sunny afternoon, all the animals were enjoying their afternoon nap. Barnaby was dreaming of honey, and Felicity the Fox was dreaming of catching mice. Suddenly, Percy flew overhead, yelling, "FIRE TRUCK! WHOOP-WHOOP! LET'S HAVE A PARADE!" Barnaby jolted awake with a terrible headache. "Percy, please!" groaned Barnaby, covering his ears. "It's nap time! We need quiet!" Percy just tilted his head and squawked, "Quiet? That sounds boring! HELLO, QUIET!"</p>

<h3>The Messy Plan</h3>
<p>The next day, Barnaby and Felicity came up with a funny plan. They waited until Percy flew out to find berries. Then, they quietly snuck into Percy's favourite tree and covered every single berry in the tree with sticky, harmless mud. When Percy returned, he was furious! "My berries are ruined! Who did this?" he shouted, but no one answered—they were all napping peacefully.</p>

<h3>The Quiet Revelation</h3>
<p>Percy kept yelling and shouting, demanding to know who ruined his berries. He yelled so much that his throat began to hurt. Finally, hoarse and tired, he landed next to Barnaby's tree. "Barnaby," he managed to whisper. "My throat... it hurts." Barnaby opened one eye. "Ah, Percy. Now you know what it feels like when things are noisy all the time. Your voice needs a rest, just like we need a rest." Percy finally understood. He spent the rest of the day in silence. The next morning, he still talked and sang, but he learned to respect the quiet hours, realizing that even the loudest parrot needs a break sometimes.</p>
