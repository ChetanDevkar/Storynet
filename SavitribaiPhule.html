    <h2>About Savitribai Phule</h2>
    <p>
      Savitribai Phule (1831–1897) was a pioneering **Indian social reformer, educationalist, and poet** from Maharashtra. She is widely regarded as the **first female teacher of India** and the mother of Indian feminism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alongside her husband, **Jyotirao Phule**, she played a crucial role in improving women's rights in India. In 1848, the couple started the **first girls' school** run by Indians in Pune, advocating for the education of girls and people from marginalized communities.
      </p>
    <p>
      Savitribai faced immense social opposition, yet she courageously dedicated her life to fighting against the caste system, patriarchy, and illiteracy, leaving a profound legacy of equality and justice.

     <h3>An Early Marriage and the Power of Knowledge</h3>
<p>Savitribai Phule was born on **January 3, 1831**, in Naigaon, Maharashtra. She was married at the age of nine to **Jyotirao Phule**, who was 13. Though she was illiterate at the time, her husband began her education at home—an extremely radical act in 19th-century India, where education for women was strictly forbidden by society. Savitribai embraced learning with passion, eventually undergoing teacher training.</p>

<h3>The First School and Social Persecution</h3>
<p>In **1848**, Savitribai and Jyotirao opened the first school for girls in Pune. Savitribai became India's first female teacher, a role that brought her intense persecution. Conservative elements of society were outraged that women, especially those from lower castes, were receiving education. On her way to school, people would routinely throw **cow dung and stones** at her. Savitribai carried an extra sari in her bag, changed out of the soiled one at school, and continued teaching.</p>

<h3>A Mother to All</h3>
<p>Savitribai and Jyotirao established several more schools over the years. They also founded the **Mahila Seva Mandal (Women's Service League)** to raise awareness about women's rights and dignity. Furthermore, they ran a **Bala-Hatya Pratibandhak Griha** (Infanticide Prevention Home) to save pregnant widows and rape victims and help them deliver their children safely. She also opened a well in her own house for untouchables during a drought when they were denied access to public wells.</p>

<h3>The Fight Against the Plague</h3>
<p>Savitribai’s devotion to social service was evident until the very end of her life. In **1897**, when the bubonic plague hit the Pune region, she and her adopted son, Yashwant Rao, opened a clinic and tirelessly served the sick. She personally carried affected patients to the clinic. It was while serving the patients that she contracted the disease herself, passing away on **March 10, 1897**, as a martyr to social justice and public health.</p>

<h3>A Legacy of Equality</h3>
<p>Savitribai Phule's life is a monumental testament to her unwavering belief that **education is the greatest weapon** against social inequality. Through poetry, teaching, and fearless action, she lit the path for female emancipation and social reform in modern India, creating a movement that defined courage and compassion.</p>
