    <h2>About Maharana Pratap</h2>
    <p>
      Maharana Pratap (1540–1597) was the **13th Rajput king of Mewar** (in modern-day Rajasthan). He is celebrated as a heroic figure in Indian history for his unwavering resistance against the expansionist policies of the **Mughal Emperor Akbar**.
    </p>
    <p>
      He famously refused to submit to the Mughal Empire, choosing to live a difficult life in the jungles rather than compromise his independence. His courage and determination were famously displayed during the **Battle of Haldighati in 1576**.
      </p>
    <p>
      Maharana Pratap’s refusal to surrender—despite massive military disadvantages—cemented his legacy as a symbol of **Rajput pride, self-respect, and patriotic defiance**.

     <h3>The Young Prince of Mewar</h3>
<p>Maharana Pratap was born on **May 9, 1540**, in Kumbhalgarh, to Maharana Udai Singh II and Rani Jayawantabai. Even as a child, he showed great courage and a strong sense of pride. He was trained in warfare and administration from a young age, preparing him for the difficult destiny that awaited him—defending his ancestral kingdom against the mightiest empire of the time.</p>

<h3>A Vow of Resistance</h3>
<p>Following the death of his father in 1572, Maharana Pratap inherited a kingdom in crisis. Many fellow Rajput rulers had allied with or submitted to the Mughal Emperor Akbar, who controlled much of Northern India. Maharana Pratap, however, made a solemn vow: he would not bow his head to the foreign emperor and would reclaim the honor of his clan and Mewar. He famously refused all diplomatic missions sent by Akbar, insisting on complete independence.</p>

<h3>The Battle of Haldighati (1576)</h3>
<p>The conflict culminated in the legendary **Battle of Haldighati in 1576**. Maharana Pratap, leading a small force of Rajputs and Bhil tribesmen, faced a massive Mughal army led by Raja Man Singh of Amber. Although the Mewar forces were heavily outnumbered, they fought with ferocious courage. Pratap's famous horse, **Chetak**, played a heroic role, carrying the wounded Maharana to safety after the battle, before succumbing to its injuries. Though the Mughals claimed victory, they failed to capture Pratap.</p>

<h3>Life in Exile and Guerrilla Warfare</h3>
<p>After the battle, Maharana Pratap retreated to the rugged hills and forests of the Aravallis. He refused to give up the fight, launching a campaign of **guerrilla warfare** to harass the Mughal garrisons. He and his family endured immense hardships, often living on bread made from wild grass, yet he never surrendered. This period of sustained resistance inspired immense loyalty among his subjects.</p>

<h3>Reclaiming the Kingdom</h3>
<p>In the final years of his life, Maharana Pratap launched several successful counter-attacks. He managed to regain control over much of Mewar's territory, making **Chavand** his new capital. He died in 1597, leaving behind a legacy not defined by a crushing military victory, but by his **unyielding spirit** and determination to protect the self-respect and freedom of his kingdom against all odds. He became, and remains, a timeless symbol of patriotic defiance.</p>
