      <h2>About Dr. B. R. Ambedkar</h2>
      <p>
        Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (1891–1956), also known as **Babasaheb Ambedkar**, was an Indian jurist, economist, and social reformer. He was the **chief architect of the Indian Constitution** and a lifelong advocate for the rights of the marginalized and oppressed, especially Dalits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ambedkar was the **first law minister of independent India**. He inspired the **Dalit Buddhist Movement** and tirelessly campaigned against social discrimination. His contribution to Indian democracy, law, and equality is immense and unforgettable.
      </p>
      <p>
        He earned multiple doctorates from prestigious institutions (including from **Columbia University** and the **London School of Economics**) and is remembered as a true visionary who worked toward social justice and upliftment of all.

        <h3>A Difficult Start and the Power of Education</h3>
        <p>Bhimrao was born on April 14, 1891, in Mhow (now in Madhya Pradesh). He belonged to the Mahar community, which was considered untouchable at the time. Despite facing severe discrimination and humiliation from a very young age—including being made to sit separately in school and being denied water—his thirst for knowledge was immense. His father, Ramji Maloji Sakpal, encouraged him to study, instilling the belief that **education was the most powerful tool** against oppression.</p>

        <h3>Journey to Global Education</h3>
        <p>Ambedkar’s talent was recognized by the Maharaja of Baroda, who granted him a scholarship. This support allowed him to pursue higher studies in the United States and the United Kingdom. He earned a Master's degree and a Ph.D. from **Columbia University** and a D.Sc. from the **London School of Economics**. His academic focus was primarily on economics, law, and political science. This incredible educational background made him one of the most highly educated people of his time globally.</p>

        <h3>Fighting for Social Justice</h3>
        <p>Upon returning to India, he dedicated his life to reforming society. He launched various journals, including **Mooknayak** (Leader of the Silent) and **Bahishkrit Bharat** (Excluded India), to voice the concerns of the oppressed. He led key protests, such as the **Mahad Satyagraha** in 1927, to assert the right of Dalits to use public water resources. He believed that political power and social revolution were necessary to dismantle the caste system.</p>

        <h3>The Architect of the Constitution</h3>
        <p>After India gained independence, Dr. Ambedkar was appointed as the Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution. For two years and eleven months, he worked tirelessly, ensuring the Constitution was a document that enshrined **equality, liberty, fraternity, and justice** for every citizen. He championed fundamental rights and included special provisions to protect marginalized communities, making India the world’s largest democracy with a strong commitment to social equity.</p>
        
        <h3>The Final Path</h3>
        <p>Disappointed with the slow pace of social reform in Hinduism, Dr. Ambedkar converted to **Buddhism** in 1956, along with hundreds of thousands of his followers. He passed away shortly after, leaving behind a legacy as the **Father of the Indian Constitution** and a revolutionary figure whose ideas continue to shape India’s commitment to social justice.</p>
