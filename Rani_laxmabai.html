      <h2>About Rani Lakshmibai</h2>
      <p>
        Rani Lakshmibai, the Queen of Jhansi, was a brave warrior who stood up
        against British rule during the **First War of Indian Independence in 1857**.
        She was born as **Manikarnika in 1828** and later became the queen of
        Jhansi.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the British tried to annex Jhansi, she refused to give up her
        kingdom. With her baby son tied to her back, she rode into battle on a
        horse and led her army with great courage. Children admire her bravery
        because she never gave up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her famous saying was, **"Main apni Jhansi nahi doongi!"** (I will not give
        up my Jhansi!). Even though she was outnumbered, she fought till her
        last breath. Rani Lakshmibai is remembered as a symbol of resistance and
        inspiration.

      <h3>A Brave Girl from Childhood</h3>
      <p>
        In 1828, in the holy city of Varanasi, a girl named **Manikarnika** was
        born. (A Brave Girl from Childhood) She was called **Manu** by her family.
        Her father, Moropant Tambe, worked in the court of the Peshwa, and her
        mother, Bhagirathi Bai, was a cultured and religious woman. From an
        early age, Manu displayed unusual courage and intelligence. She learned
        horse riding on her favorite horse ‘Badal’, practiced sword fighting
        with wooden sticks, and even joined wrestling games with the boys. She
        was not an ordinary girl; she had a spirit that could not be tamed.
      </p>

      <h3>Becoming the Queen of Jhansi</h3>
      <p>
        Manu’s life changed when she married the Maharaja of Jhansi, Raja
        Gangadhar Rao, and became known as **Rani Lakshmibai**. She entered the
        royal palace with grace and quickly won the hearts of her people. The
        queen actively took part in palace affairs, learned about
        administration, and always kept an eye on the well-being of her
        subjects.
      </p>

      <h3>A Sudden Tragedy</h3>
      <p>
        (A Sudden Tragedy) In 1853, her husband passed away, leaving her with an
        adopted son, **Damodar Rao**. The British East India Company, under Lord
        Dalhousie, refused to recognize the adoption and announced the
        annexation of Jhansi under the **Doctrine of Lapse**. The Rani was deeply
        hurt but remained determined to protect her kingdom.
      </p>

      <h3>Preparing for Battle</h3>
      <p>
        Instead of surrendering, Rani Lakshmibai began preparing for resistance.
        She fortified the walls of Jhansi fort, collected weapons, and recruited
        soldiers. Uniquely, she also trained women to fight, showing her belief
        in equality and unity. Her speeches were filled with passion, and she
        inspired her people to see Jhansi not just as land, but as their mother.
      </p>

      <h3>The First War of Independence</h3>
      <p>
        In 1857, the revolt against the British began across India. Jhansi
        became one of the strongest centers of the rebellion. The Rani led her
        forces with discipline, personally participating in the planning of
        strategies. Her courage was not limited to words—she fought in the front
        lines.
      </p>

      <h3>The Fierce Battle for Jhansi</h3>
      <p>
        In March 1858, British forces under **Sir Hugh Rose** attacked Jhansi. For
        two weeks, Rani Lakshmibai and her army defended the fort. The cannons
        roared, arrows flew, and swords clashed, but Jhansi stood firm. When the
        walls were finally breached, she made a daring escape at night, riding
        her horse with her young son tied to her back.
      </p>

      <h3>Alliance with Other Rebels</h3>
      <p>
        After escaping Jhansi, she joined forces with **Tatya Tope** and other
        leaders. Together, they captured the fort of Gwalior, which became a new
        base for their resistance. Even in the face of exhaustion and injury,
        she continued to lead her troops with unmatched energy.
      </p>

      <h3>The Final Stand</h3>
      <p>
        In June 1858, the British attacked Gwalior. Rani Lakshmibai, dressed in
        a soldier’s uniform, led her troops fearlessly. She fought fiercely, but
        during the battle, she was wounded. Refusing to be captured, she
        continued fighting until her last breath. Even her enemies admired her
        bravery, calling her the **“best and bravest”** leader of the revolt.
      </p>

      <h3>Her Immortal Legacy</h3>
      <p>
        Rani Lakshmibai’s sacrifice became a source of inspiration for
        generations. Her life proved that determination, courage, and love for
        one’s land could challenge even the mightiest empires. Today, she
        remains a symbol of patriotism and women’s empowerment in India’s
        history.
