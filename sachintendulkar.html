        <h3>A Young Prodigy is Found</h3>
        <p>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar was born on **April 24, 1973**, in Mumbai. His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a renowned Marathi novelist. As a mischievous young boy, he was sent to cricket coach **Ramakant Achrekar** at the age of 11. Achrekar quickly recognized Sachin's extraordinary talent and dedication. Sachin would practice for hours, and his coach would often place a rupee coin on the stumps; if Sachin remained 'not out,' he won the coin. This simple act taught him focus and discipline.</p>

        <h3>The Record-Breaking Partnership</h3>
        <p>In 1988, at the age of 14, Sachin and his schoolmate Vinod Kambli set a world-record partnership of **664 runs** in a school match. This feat brought him into the national spotlight and fast-tracked his career. Just a year later, at the tender age of **16**, he made his debut for the Indian cricket team against Pakistan, facing legendary fast bowlers like Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram.</p>
        
        <h3>The Little Master's Reign</h3>
        <p>Sachin's career spanned 24 years, during which he broke almost every major batting record. His dedication transcended mere statistics; he carried the burden of a billion expectations on his shoulders in every match. Key milestones include scoring his first Test century in England at the age of 17, and his legendary "Desert Storm" innings in Sharjah in 1998, which captivated the world.</p>

        <h3>The Ultimate Dream</h3>
        <p>Despite years of individual success, the one trophy that eluded him was the Cricket World Cup. Finally, in **2011**, playing in his sixth World Cup, India lifted the trophy in his home city of Mumbai. This victory was a heartfelt tribute from his teammates, who carried him on their shoulders around the Wankhede Stadium—a moment that remains an iconic symbol of his dedication to the nation.</p>

        <h3>Legacy and Retirement</h3>
        <p>Sachin retired from all forms of international cricket in **November 2013**, after playing his 200th Test match. He finished his career as the leading run-scorer and century-maker in both Test and ODI cricket. Beyond the records, his legacy is one of humility, respect for the game, and inspiring generations across India and the world to pursue their passion with dedication.</p>
