     <h3>A Dream Under the Village Sky</h3>
<p>Maya Sharma lived in a small village where the nights were dark and the stars were impossibly bright. Unlike the other children, Maya did not look at the ground; she looked up. Her dream was to become a **space scientist**. However, her family was poor, and the nearest science college was over a hundred miles away. Her father, a simple farmer, would gently tell her, "Stars are for dreaming, Maya, not for studying."</p>

<h3>The Challenge of the Test</h3>
<p>When Maya was 16, she learned about a national science scholarship—her only path to a proper education. The entrance test was held in the distant city, and the syllabus was far beyond what her small village school taught. Maya refused to be defeated. She borrowed old books from a teacher, studied late into the night by a kerosene lamp, and walked ten miles every weekend to use the tiny library in the next town. Her dedication was absolute.</p>

<h3>The Moment of Failure</h3>
<p>Despite all her hard work, Maya **failed the scholarship test** on her first attempt. She was heartbroken. The village gossips said, "She should stick to the farm. This science is not for girls like her." For a week, Maya cried, but then she remembered the endless journey of the stars—they never stop moving. She realized that failure was just feedback, not a final destination.</p>

<h3>The Second Chance</h3>
<p>Maya decided to try again. She wrote letters to college professors asking for help, and one old retired professor, impressed by her tenacity, agreed to mentor her through letters. She worked twice as hard, using her farm chores as physical training for her mind. The next year, Maya took the test again, and this time, she didn't just pass—**she topped the list!**</p>

<h3>Reaching Her Destiny</h3>
<p>Maya went on to earn her degrees, never forgetting the village and the struggles that made her strong. Today, Dr. Maya Sharma works at the country's space research center, designing parts for rockets that reach beyond the moon. Her story taught everyone that with enough hard work, dedication, and the will to try 'one more time,' even the girl who started under the dim light of a kerosene lamp can reach the brightest stars.</p>
