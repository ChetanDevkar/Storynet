    <h2>About Jawaharlal Nehru</h2>
    <p>
      Jawaharlal Nehru (1889–1964) was a key leader of the Indian independence movement and served as the **first Prime Minister of independent India** from 1947 until his death. He is widely considered the architect of the modern Indian nation-state.
    </p>
    <p>
      A staunch believer in democracy, socialism, and secularism, Nehru laid the foundation for India's domestic and foreign policies, introducing the concepts of the **Five-Year Plans** and the **Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)** on the global stage.
      </p>
    <p>
      Known affectionately as **'Pandit Nehru,'** he was deeply committed to promoting science, technology, and universal education, shaping India into a stable, democratic republic in its early years.

     <h3>Privilege and Education</h3>
<p>Jawaharlal Nehru was born on **November 14, 1889**, in Allahabad. He was the son of Motilal Nehru, a wealthy barrister and prominent nationalist leader. Nehru received a privileged education, attending prestigious institutions in England, including **Harrow School** and **Trinity College, Cambridge**. He returned to India in 1912, intending to practice law, but soon found himself drawn into the burgeoning struggle for independence.</p>

<h3>The Call to the Freedom Struggle</h3>
<p>Nehru’s life changed profoundly after meeting **Mahatma Gandhi** in 1916. Inspired by Gandhi’s call for mass mobilization and non-cooperation, Nehru abandoned his Western lifestyle and legal career to fully dedicate himself to the cause of freedom. He quickly rose through the ranks of the **Indian National Congress**, suffering imprisonment multiple times at the hands of the British authorities for his activism.</p>

<h3>A Vision for Independent India</h3>
<p>Nehru was a radical voice within the Congress, advocating for complete independence (**Purna Swaraj**), which was officially adopted as the goal of the Congress in 1929 under his presidency. His vision for a free India was clear: it would be a **secular, democratic republic** built on socialist principles, ensuring equality for all citizens. His intellectual depth and modern outlook made him the spiritual successor to Gandhi in leading the nation forward.</p>

<h3>The Midnight Hour (1947)</h3>
<p>On **August 15, 1947**, at the stroke of midnight, Jawaharlal Nehru delivered his iconic **'Tryst with Destiny'** speech, marking India's independence. As the first Prime Minister, his primary task was nation-building—integrating hundreds of princely states, establishing a parliamentary democracy, and modernizing a poor, newly independent nation. He prioritized science, industry, and a planned economy.</p>

<h3>Architect of Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>On the international stage, Nehru was the pioneer of the **Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)**, positioning India as a leader among newly independent nations that wished to remain outside the Cold War power blocs. His focus on peace, international cooperation, and anti-colonialism earned him respect as a global statesman. He remained Prime Minister until his death in 1964, leaving behind a legacy as the creator of modern India's democratic foundations.</p>
