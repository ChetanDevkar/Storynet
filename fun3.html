     <h3>Reddy's Big Complaint</h3>
<p>Reddy was a traffic light at the busiest intersection in the city. His job was simple: turn **Red** (STOP!), **Yellow** (GET READY!), and **Green** (GO!). Reddy was very good at his job, maybe too good. He was a stickler for rules. But every day, he saw drivers sneak through his Red light, or jump out of line on Green. "It's an absolute outrage!" boomed Reddy (though only cars could hear his inner voice). "They treat me like a suggestion, not a law!"</p>

<h3>The Strike</h3>
<p>One Tuesday morning, Reddy decided he’d had enough. He refused to change his color. He stayed completely dark. "If they won't obey me, I'm taking the day off," he decided grumpily. Suddenly, the entire intersection went silent. The drivers looked at each other, confused. Then, since there was no Red to stop them, every single driver decided to go at once!</p>

<h3>An Absolute Mess</h3>
<p>A huge, noisy, brightly colored mess erupted! Mrs. Sharma, driving her yellow scooter, tried to turn right while Mr. Singh, driving his massive blue bus, tried to go straight, and poor Pablo the Pizza Delivery boy, on his red bicycle, tried to sneak across the middle. Horns blared like a symphony of grumpy geese! Cars nudged, bumped, and twisted until the intersection looked less like a road and more like a giant, metallic knot tied by a toddler. Nothing moved for three hours!</p>

<h3>A Flash of Insight (and Green)</h3>
<p>Reddy, observing the disaster from his pole, slowly realized his mistake. It wasn't that the drivers didn't need him; it was that they needed him *more* than ever. He wasn't just a rule; he was the **organizer of the chaos**! He sighed, realizing his job, though tough, was essential. With a happy little *click*, Reddy turned on his **Green** light for the north-south lane, and slowly, the great metallic knot began to untangle itself.</p>

<h3>Back to Work</h3>
<p>The drivers were relieved, and they obeyed Reddy's colors perfectly for the rest of the day. Reddy learned that even if people sometimes ignore the rules, the rules are important because they keep everyone safe and moving. From then on, Reddy still turned Red and Grumpy sometimes, but he never forgot that he was the most important light in the whole city.</p>

    <h2>Fun Lessons</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>**Rules keep things moving:** Even simple rules, like Red and Green, keep the whole world from becoming a tangled mess.</li>
      <li>**Everyone has an important job:** No matter how small your role seems, the entire system needs you to work.</li>
      <li>**Chaos is contagious:** When one person decides to break the rules, everyone else suffers!</li>
