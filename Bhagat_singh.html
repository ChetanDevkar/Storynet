    <h2>About Bhagat Singh</h2>
    <p>
      Bhagat Singh (1907–1931) was one of India’s most influential freedom fighters. Born in Punjab, he became a symbol of bravery and revolutionary spirit against British rule. At a very young age, he joined the fight for independence and became a voice of the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was involved in the Central Legislative Assembly bombing in 1929, intended as a protest, not to harm anyone. Bhagat Singh embraced death fearlessly and was executed at the age of 23. His sacrifice continues to inspire millions across India.

     <h3>A Baby Born for Freedom</h3>
<p>Long ago, in Banga village of Punjab, on 28 September 1907, a boy was born into a family of freedom fighters. 
  His father, Kishan Singh,and uncles were already active in the fight against British rule. His mother, Vidyavati,
   often told him stories of bravery and sacrifice. 
  This child was named Bhagat Singh.</p>
<p>Even as a young boy, Bhagat was serious and thoughtful. While other children played with toys, he planted trees a
  e about “driving the 
  British out of India.”</p>

<h3>A Child Who Loved the Soil of His Country</h3>
<p>As he grew older, Bhagat Singh began visiting places connected to India’s freedom struggle. At the age of 12, he 
   Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, where hundreds of innocent people had been killed in 1919 by British soldiers. He 
   llected some blood-soaked soil from the ground, placed it in a bottle, and worshipped it. That day, he made a vow to
   te his life to India's freedom.</p>

<h3>Learning the Ways of Revolution</h3>
<p>During his teenage years, Bhagat joined student groups that discussed politics and read books about revolutionar
  
   around the world. He admired leaders like Lenin and Garibaldi. He believed freedom could not be begged for—it ha
   to be taken by force. He later joined the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), where brave young men a
   n prepared to fight for India's liberation.</p>

<h3>The Fight for Lala Lajpat Rai’s Death</h3>
<p>In 1928, the great leader Lala Lajpat Rai was injured during a peaceful protest against the Simon Commission and
  
  ied. Bhagat Singh was outraged. He and his comrades planned to kill James A. Scott, the police officer responsibl
   However, due to mistaken identity, they ended up killing John Saunders. The British launched a nationwide manhunt fo
   t Singh.</p>

<h3>The Bomb in the Assembly</h3>
<p>In 1929, Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt threw harmless bombs in the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi—not
  
   anyone, but to “make the deaf hear.” They did not flee the scene. Instead, they shouted “Inquilab Zindabad!” (Lo
    Live the Revolution!) and surrendered, hoping the trial would give them a platform to share their message.</p>

<h3>The Trial and the Prison Days</h3>
<p>While in jail, Bhagat Singh read extensively and wrote letters about his dream of a free, equal, and just India.
  
  sed to ask for mercy and even went on a hunger strike to demand fair treatment for Indian political prisoners. Hi
  courage inspired the entire nation. Newspapers published his speeches, and people everywhere began to see him as a national hero.</p>

<h3>The Final Sacrifice – 23 March 1931</h3>
<p>Bhagat Singh, along with Rajguru and Sukhdev, was sentenced to death. On the evening of 23 March 1931, they walk
  
  e gallows with smiles on their faces, singing patriotic songs. Bhagat Singh was only 23 years old.</p>
<p>His death shook the nation, but it also ignited a fire in the hearts of millions to rise and fight for freedom.<
  

<h3>Legacy of a Legend</h3>
<p>Even today, the name Bhagat Singh stands for bravery, sacrifice, and deep love for the motherland. He proved that even a short life, lived with courage and purpose, can inspire generations to come.</p>
