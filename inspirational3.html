     <h3>The Girl Who Saw Stars in Karnal</h3>
<p>Kalpana Chawla was born in **Karnal, Haryana**, on March 17, 1962. From a young age, she was fascinated by airplanes. She would often go with her father to local flying clubs to watch the planes take off, and she excelled in science and drawing. While her peers dreamt of conventional careers, Kalpana told her teacher she wanted to be an astronaut. This dream, coming from a girl in a small Indian town, seemed impossible to many, but not to her.</p>

<h3>The Journey Across Continents</h3>
<p>Kalpana pursued her Bachelor of Engineering degree in Aeronautical Engineering from **Punjab Engineering College**. Against many societal expectations that urged her to settle for a local job or marriage, she convinced her family to let her pursue higher studies in the United States. She earned two Masters degrees and a Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering, proving her exceptional talent and academic discipline.</p>

<h3>Selection at NASA</h3>
<p>After working at NASA’s Ames Research Center, Kalpana applied to the astronaut corps. In **1994**, she was selected by NASA—a dream realized after years of relentless effort. Her commitment to aviation was deep; she was a certified flight instructor and held commercial pilot licenses for single and multi-engine planes and gliders.</p>

<h3>The First Flight (STS-87)</h3>
<p>In **1997**, Kalpana Chawla embarked on her first mission aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia (**STS-87**). She spent over 15 days in space, observing the Earth and conducting numerous scientific experiments. When she returned, she often spoke to children, urging them to follow their passions, saying, "The path from dreams to success does exist. May you have the vision to find it, the courage to get on to it, and the perseverance to follow it."</p>

<h3>The Final Mission and Legacy</h3>
<p>In 2003, Kalpana Chawla launched on her second mission, **STS-107**, with six crewmates. After a successful 16-day scientific mission, the shuttle tragically broke up during re-entry on February 1, 2003. Though her life was cut short, Kalpana's pioneering spirit lives on. She is remembered not for how she died, but for how she lived—a fearless, determined woman who transformed a childhood dream under an Indian sky into a legacy among the stars.</p>
