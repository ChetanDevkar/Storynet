     <h3>A Very Thirsty Day</h3>
<p>On a hot, sunny afternoon, a crow named Kaalu felt incredibly thirsty. He flew far and wide, searching for water, his throat dry and scratchy. He checked puddles, ponds, and even the shallow bowls left for pets, but every source was either completely dry or too dirty to drink. Kaalu was starting to lose hope, feeling the heat beat down on his head.</p>

<h3>The Challenge of the Pitcher</h3>
<p>Finally, Kaalu spotted something promising! Below a sprawling banyan tree sat a terracotta pitcher, half-hidden by weeds. Kaalu flew down quickly, his heart thumping. He peered inside and saw water! But as he dipped his beak, he realized the water level was too low. The pitcher was tall, and no matter how far he stretched, he couldn't reach the precious liquid. The sides of the pitcher were too smooth to grasp, and he couldn't knock it over.</p>

<h3>The Lightbulb Moment</h3>
<p>Kaalu felt frustrated, but he didn't give up. He looked around, thinking hard. He noticed small pebbles scattered near the base of the tree. Suddenly, an idea sparked! Kaalu realized that if he added something heavy to the water, the water level would have to rise. It was a perfect plan! This was much funnier than just flying away.</p>

<h3>The Solution in Action</h3>
<p>With great focus, Kaalu flew down and picked up the first pebble. *Plop!* It dropped into the pitcher. The water level moved a tiny bit. Undeterred, Kaalu flew back and forth, picking up pebble after pebble. He worked patiently, dropping each stone into the pitcher's neck. *Plop, plop, plop!* His wings grew tired, but his determination kept him going.</p>

<h3>A Well-Earned Drink</h3>
<p>After what felt like a hundred trips, the water level finally rose high enough! Kaalu bent his head, took a long, refreshing drink, and chirped happily. His smart thinking and hard work had saved the day! He ruffled his feathers proudly, knowing that a clever mind is the best tool, even for a thirsty crow.</p>
