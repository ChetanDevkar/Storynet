     <h3>The Loss of a Livelihood</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, there lived a poor woodcutter who worked hard every day to earn a living. He had only one possession of value: his axe, made of plain iron. One day, while chopping wood near a swiftly flowing river, the axe slipped from his sweaty hand and plunged into the deep water. The woodcutter was devastated. Without his axe, he could not chop wood, and without wood, his family would starve. He sat by the riverbank and wept bitterly.</p>

<h3>The Test of Honesty</h3>
<p>Suddenly, a beautiful Water Spirit emerged from the river. She saw the woodcutter's distress and asked what was wrong. After hearing his tale, the Spirit dived into the water. She reappeared holding a magnificent **golden axe** and asked, "Is this your axe?" The woodcutter shook his head sadly and replied, "No, Madam. That beautiful golden axe is not mine."</p>

<h3>Integrity Rewarded</h3>
<p>The Water Spirit dived again. This time, she brought up a shimmering **silver axe**. "Is this one yours?" she asked. Again, the woodcutter replied honestly, "No, Madam. That silver axe is also not mine. My axe is made of simple iron." The Spirit smiled, impressed by his unwavering honesty. She dived a third time and brought up his own old, iron axe. "Yes! That is mine!" cried the woodcutter with joy.</p>

<h3>The Moral Treasure</h3>
<p>The Water Spirit was so touched by the woodcutter's honesty that she decided to reward him. She handed him his iron axe and, to his astonishment, she gave him both the golden and the silver axes as gifts. "You are an honest man," she said. "The gold and silver are yours, because you valued truth over greed." The woodcutter returned home rich, not just in wealth, but in the knowledge that **honesty is the best policy**.</p>
