      <h2>About Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</h2>
      <p>
        Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj (1630 - 1680) was a great Maratha warrior
        and the founder of the **Maratha Empire** in western India. Born in the
        hill-fort of **Shivneri**, he rose to prominence with his **guerrilla warfare**
        tactics and valor. King of dhackhan.
      </p>
      <p>
        He established a progressive civil rule with well-structured
        administration. Shivaji Maharaj was known for his **respect for all
        religions**, courage, and visionary leadership. He was crowned as
        **Chhatrapati in 1674 at Raigad Fort**, and his legacy remains a symbol of
        pride and bravery in Indian history.

      <h3>A Brave Baby is Born – 1630</h3>
      <p>
        Long ago, in the Sahyadri mountains of Maharashtra, there was a strong
        stone fort called **Shivneri**. **(A Brave Baby is Born – 1630)** Inside
        this fort, on **19 February 1630**, a baby boy was born to Shahaji Raje
        Bhosale and **Jijabai**. Before his birth, Jijabai had prayed to Goddess
        Bhavani for a son who would protect the people. Holding the newborn, she
        whispered: “You will never bow to injustice, my Shivba.” From childhood,
        Shivaji liked playing with toy swords and bows. He enjoyed riding horses
        and exploring the hills, preparing unknowingly for the life of a
        warrior.
      </p>

      <h3>The Big Dream – 1645</h3>
      <p>
        Shivaji spent most of his early life at Pune, where Jijabai raised him
        with strong values. **(The Big Dream – 1645)** She told him stories of
        Rama, Krishna, and the brave kings of the past. One day, when he was
        around 15, he stood on a hill with his friends and looked at the land
        below. It was rich and beautiful — but ruled by foreign kings like the
        Mughals and the Adil Shah of Bijapur. Shivaji said to his friends: “Our
        land should belong to our own people. We will build a **Swarajya** — a
        kingdom of freedom!” His friends, the **Mavalas**, promised to help him no
        matter what. That day, the dream of Swarajya began.
      </p>

      <h3>The First Fort is Ours – 1646</h3>
      <p>
        Shivaji’s first target was **Torna Fort**, a huge fort in the mountains.
        With only a small group of loyal Mavalas, he climbed the steep paths at
        night. The guards at the fort were not expecting trouble, so the young
        warriors were able to take control without much fighting. By morning,
        the saffron flag was flying proudly on Torna. Shivaji smiled and said:
        “This is our first step. Soon, many more forts will join us.” This
        victory made other villages believe in his dream.
      </p>

      <h3>The Brave Mavalas and More Forts</h3>
      <p>
        Shivaji’s soldiers were called **Mavalas** because they came from the Maval
        region near Pune. They were farmers and hunters, used to living in the
        mountains. They could run up steep slopes, hide in forests, and fight
        with great skill. With their help, Shivaji captured many forts one after
        another — Purandar, Rajgad, Kondhana (later called **Sinhagad**), and more.
        Each fort became a safe place for his people and a strong defense
        against enemies. By now, the saffron flag could be seen from one hill to
        the next.
      </p>

      <h3>The Night Attack on Shaista Khan – 1663</h3>
      <p>
        The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb sent **Shaista Khan**, a powerful general, to
        defeat Shivaji. Shaista Khan captured Pune and moved into **Lal Mahal**,
        which was Shivaji’s own childhood palace! Shivaji could not bear this
        insult. He decided on a bold plan. One night, he and 400 Mavalas
        disguised themselves as wedding guests and quietly entered Pune. Moving
        through dark alleys, they reached Lal Mahal. With a sudden burst,
        Shivaji entered Shaista Khan’s bedroom and attacked him. Shaista Khan
        escaped, but not before losing three fingers to Shivaji’s sword. By the
        time the Mughal soldiers reacted, Shivaji and his men had disappeared
        into the night. It was one of the most daring raids in Indian history.
      </p>

      <h3>The Trick of the Tiger Claws – 1659</h3>
      Even before Shaista Khan’s attack, the Bijapur Sultan had sent his
      strongest general, **Afzal Khan**, to crush Shivaji. Afzal Khan was huge and
      powerful, and he tried to lure Shivaji into a trap by inviting him for a
      private meeting at the base of **Pratapgad Fort**. Shivaji suspected danger.
      He wore armor under his clothes and hid a deadly weapon — the **wagh nakh**
      (tiger claws) — in his hand. When Afzal Khan tried to stab him during the
      meeting, Shivaji struck back with the tiger claws. Afzal Khan fell,
      wounded, and the Maratha army, waiting nearby, charged into battle. By the
      end of the day, the Marathas had won a huge victory.

      <h3>The Great Escape from Agra – 1666</h3>
      <p>
        Aurangzeb later invited Shivaji to **Agra** for peace talks. But instead of
        giving him respect, Aurangzeb placed him behind lesser nobles in the
        court. Shivaji felt insulted and walked out. The Mughals placed him
        under house arrest. Shivaji planned a clever escape. He pretended to
        send baskets of sweets to the poor. Inside two of those baskets were
        **Shivaji and his son Sambhaji**! The baskets were carried out of Agra
        without suspicion, and by the time anyone noticed, Shivaji was far away.
      </p>

      <h3>The Chhatrapati of the People – 1674</h3>
      <p>
        After many victories, Shivaji was crowned king at **Raigad Fort in 1674**.
        The fort was decorated with flowers and saffron flags. Priests from
        across the land came to bless him. Shivaji became **Chhatrapati Shivaji
        Maharaj**. He ruled with fairness — protecting farmers, respecting women,
        and giving importance to all religions. He also built a strong navy to
        guard the coastline.
      </p>

      <h3>The Last Sunset – 1680</h3>
      <p>
        * On **3 April 1680**, at Raigad Fort, Shivaji Maharaj passed away. But his
        dream of Swarajya did not die with him. His ideals inspired generations
        of freedom fighters in India. Even today, people remember him as the
        brave king who fought for justice, freedom, and the dignity of his
        people. BUt we Can feel him in the Sahyadri.
