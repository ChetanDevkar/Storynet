    <h2>About Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj</h2>
    <p>
      Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj (1657–1689) was the eldest son of Chhatrapati **Shivaji Maharaj** and the **second ruler (Chhatrapati)** of the Maratha Empire. A brilliant military strategist and fierce warrior, he successfully defended the growing Maratha Swarajya against the overwhelming might of the Mughal Empire under Aurangzeb.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not only a warrior but also a learned scholar, proficient in **Sanskrit** and several other languages. He authored the famous text, **'Budhabhushan'**.
      </p>
    <p>
      Sambhaji Maharaj bravely faced torture and martyrdom for the cause of Swarajya, never compromising his Hindu faith or his kingdom's freedom. His nine-year reign was defined by relentless warfare and courageous defiance.

     <h3>Childhood and Comprehensive Training</h3>
<p>Sambhaji was born on **May 14, 1657**, at **Purandar Fort**. He lost his mother, Saibai, very early in his life. He was primarily raised and mentored by his paternal grandmother, **Jijabai**, and his father, Shivaji Maharaj. He received a rigorous education that included statecraft, warfare, and academics. By the age of 14, he was recognized for his literary prowess, having already composed the Sanskrit text **'Budhabhushan'** (The Ornament of Wisdom), detailing administration and politics.</p>

<h3>Ascension and Consolidation (1680)</h3>
<p>Upon the death of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in 1680, Sambhaji faced immediate challenges to his claim to the throne. He swiftly and decisively dealt with the internal opposition and dissent, consolidating his power and proving his capability as a sovereign ruler. He ensured the Maratha administrative machinery continued to function efficiently, even under the immense pressure of constant warfare.</p>

<h3>Defiance of the Mughal Empire</h3>
<p>Sambhaji’s nine-year reign was a continuous saga of military triumph against the largest army of the time—the **Mughal forces** under Emperor **Aurangzeb**. Aurangzeb committed his entire might, including his best generals and resources, to crush the Maratha kingdom. Sambhaji not only defended the Swarajya but also expanded it, successfully fighting battles against the Portuguese, the Mysore kingdom, and the Mughals simultaneously. His military genius and ferocity repeatedly thwarted Aurangzeb’s plans.</p>

<h3>The Scholar and The Administrator</h3>
<p>Despite constant military engagement, Sambhaji Maharaj was a visionary administrator. His court provided patronage to poets, scholars, and artists. His text, **'Budhabhushan,'** covered topics from military strategy to the duties of a king, showcasing his profound knowledge of Rajadharma. He continued his father's policies of justice, secularism, and humane governance for the farmers and common people.</p>

<h3>Capture and Immortal Martyrdom (1689)</h3>
<p>In 1689, due to betrayal, Sambhaji Maharaj was ambushed and captured by the Mughal forces at Sangameshwar. He was brought before Emperor Aurangzeb. The Emperor demanded that Sambhaji convert to Islam and surrender all his forts and treasury. Sambhaji Maharaj staunchly refused to compromise his faith or the freedom of his kingdom. He endured brutal torture for weeks but remained unbreakable. His execution on **March 11, 1689**, at Tulapur, solidified his image as a fearless martyr for Swarajya and Dharma.</p>

<h3>A Legacy of Unflinching Courage</h3>
<p>Sambhaji Maharaj’s unyielding resistance against the full power of the Mughal Empire for nine crucial years gave the Maratha Swarajya time to mature and ensured its survival after his father’s death. His ultimate sacrifice, where he refused to convert even in the face of death, became a profound source of inspiration for later generations of Maratha warriors and remains a shining example of courage and conviction in Indian history.</p>
