    <h2>About Swami Vivekananda</h2>
    <p>
      Swami Vivekananda (1863–1902), originally Narendranath Datta, was the chief disciple of the mystic Ramakrishna and a **revolutionary spiritual leader**. He introduced the philosophies of **Vedanta** and **Yoga** to the Western world, laying the foundation for modern Hindu reform.
    </p>
    <p>
      He established the **Ramakrishna Math and Mission**, dedicated to spiritual teaching and social service. His powerful speeches emphasized **self-belief, strength**, and **service to humanity**.
      </p>
    <p>
      His landmark address at the **Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893** made him a world figure. Vivekananda’s ideals continue to be a profound source of inspiration, particularly for the youth of India.

     <h3>The Brilliant Child, Narendranath</h3>
<p>Swami Vivekananda was born on **January 12, 1863**, in Kolkata as **Narendranath Datta**. Even as a child, he was known for his sharp intellect, prodigious memory, and deep curiosity about life and God. He mastered Western philosophy, history, and science, but his deepest quest was to understand the purpose of existence and to see God face-to-face.</p>

<h3>The Master's Influence</h3>
<p>His intense search led him to **Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa**, a saint at Dakshineswar. Narendra initially questioned the master skeptically, demanding proofs. However, Ramakrishna's simple, pure answers and immense love transformed him. Under Ramakrishna, Narendranath learned the core truth: **"Service to man is service to God."**</p>

<h3>The Wandering Monk</h3>
<p>After Ramakrishna's death, Narendranath embraced the life of a wandering monk, taking the name **Swami Vivekananda**. He traveled the length and breadth of India, often on foot, witnessing the extreme poverty, backwardness, and suffering of the masses. This extensive journey solidified his mission: to uplift the poor and reawaken the spiritual and material strength of the nation.</p>

<h3>The World's Attention (Chicago 1893)</h3>
<p>Driven by his desire to raise funds and awareness for India's poor, he traveled to the West. His defining moment came at the **Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893**. Starting his speech with the unforgettable phrase, **"Sisters and Brothers of America,"** he received a thunderous standing ovation. He powerfully presented the universal message of Hinduism—tolerance, acceptance, and the divinity of every soul—instantly establishing him as a world spiritual leader.</p>

<h3>The Mission and Legacy</h3>
<p>Vivekananda spent years lecturing in the US and Europe before returning to India as a national hero. He immediately founded the **Ramakrishna Math** (for monastic order) and the **Ramakrishna Mission** (for social service, healthcare, and education). He tirelessly urged the youth to adopt discipline and fearless self-belief. His call to action, **"Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached,"** remains one of the most powerful motivational slogans in India.</p>
