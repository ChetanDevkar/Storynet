    <h2>About Chandra Shekhar Azad</h2>
    <p>
      Chandra Shekhar Azad (1906–1931) was a **fearless Indian revolutionary** who vowed to never be captured alive by the British. Born in Madhya Pradesh, he joined the non-cooperation movement at a young age and later became a part of the **Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA)**.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was involved in many revolutionary activities, including the **Kakori Train Robbery** and the attempt to avenge the death of Lala Lajpat Rai. Known for his bravery and sharp shooting, he remained committed to the cause of Indian freedom until the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1931, surrounded by British forces in **Alfred Park** (now Azad Park) in Allahabad, he chose to end his life with his last bullet rather than surrender. His sacrifice remains a symbol of **patriotism and courage**.

    <h3>From Student Protestor to Revolutionary</h3>
    <p>Chandra Shekhar was born on **23 July 1906** in Bhavra village (now in Madhya Pradesh). Even as a teenager, his passion for the nation's freedom was evident. At the age of 15, he was arrested for participating in the **Non-Cooperation Movement**. When asked his name by the magistrate, he declared, **“Azad” (The Free)**, his father’s name as “Swatantrata” (Independence), and his residence as “Jail.” This incident earned him the title of 'Azad' for life and marked the beginning of his revolutionary journey.</p>
    
    <h3>The Kakori Conspiracy</h3>
    <p>Azad was a key member of the **Hindustan Republican Association (HRA)**, which he later reorganized into the **Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA)**. One of the group's most daring acts was the **Kakori Train Robbery in 1925**, where they looted government funds to buy weapons for their movement. While many comrades were caught, Azad managed to escape, solidifying his image as an elusive, highly skilled revolutionary.</p>

    <h3>Avenging a National Loss</h3>
    <p>Following the death of Lala Lajpat Rai due to injuries sustained in a police baton charge in 1928, Azad, along with Bhagat Singh and Rajguru, planned retaliation. They successfully assassinated **J.P. Saunders**, who they mistakenly believed was James A. Scott, the officer responsible for the fatal attack. Azad provided leadership, training, and strategic planning for the group, making him the most valuable and feared leader of the HSRA.</p>

    <h3>The Vow and the Final Stand</h3>
    <p>Azad lived up to his self-given name until his last breath. On **27 February 1931**, he was betrayed by an informer and surrounded by the British Police at Alfred Park in Allahabad. He fought bravely, single-handedly holding off the police for a long time. When he realized he was outnumbered and had only one bullet left, he honored his vow—**never to be captured alive**—by shooting himself. His body was cremated secretly by the British, but his legend spread instantly, inspiring a new wave of youth to join the freedom struggle.</p>
