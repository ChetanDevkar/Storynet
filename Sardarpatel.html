      <h2>About Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</h2>
      <p>
        Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel (1875–1950), known as the **“Iron Man of India,”**
        was a key leader in the Indian freedom struggle and the **first Deputy
        Prime Minister and Home Minister of independent India**.
      </p>
      <p>
        He played a pivotal role in the **unification of over 560 princely states**
        to form the Indian Union after independence. His leadership, firmness,
        and vision earned him the title **“Bismarck of India.”**
      </p>
      <p>
        Patel was also a major leader in the civil disobedience movement, and
        his efforts helped shape India’s future as a strong, united nation. He
        remains a symbol of national integration and strength.

      <h3>A Farmer’s Son with Big Dreams</h3>
      <p>
        In 1875, in the small village of Nadiad in Gujarat, a boy was born who
        would one day unite India. (A Farmer’s Son with Big Dreams) His name was
        **Vallabhbhai Patel**. He came from a humble farming family. As a child,
        Vallabhbhai was known for his determination and courage. Once, when he
        was just a young boy, he treated his own boil with a hot iron rod
        without fear, showing the toughness that would define his life.
      </p>

      <h3>The Journey to Become a Lawyer</h3>
      <p>
        Vallabhbhai was intelligent and hardworking. He studied law in **England**
        and returned to India as a successful barrister. He dressed sharply and
        was well respected in court. But deep inside, he was worried about
        India’s slavery under British rule.
      </p>

      <h3>The Call of Mahatma Gandhi</h3>
      <p>
        In 1918, when **Mahatma Gandhi** called upon the people to fight against
        injustice, Vallabhbhai Patel left his comfortable life and joined the
        freedom struggle. He led the **Kheda Satyagraha**, where farmers refused to
        pay taxes due to crop failure. Patel’s leadership forced the British to
        suspend the taxes, making him a hero of the people.
      </p>

      <h3>The Bardoli Satyagraha – Becoming the ‘Sardar’</h3>
      <p>
        In 1928, the farmers of **Bardoli** faced heavy taxes despite floods and
        famine. Vallabhbhai led a non-violent protest. His discipline and
        strategy were so strong that the British were forced to reduce the
        taxes. The women of Bardoli gave him the title **“Sardar,”** meaning leader.
      </p>

      <h3>The Iron Man of India</h3>
      <p>
        Patel was known for his firmness and ability to make tough decisions.
        After India gained independence in 1947, there were more than **500
        princely states** that were not yet part of the Indian Union. Patel worked
        day and night, convincing rulers to join India. He used a mix of
        persuasion and firmness, making sure that India remained united.
      </p>

      <h3>Unifying the Nation</h3>
      <p>
        His greatest achievement was bringing all these states together without
        large-scale violence. Because of this, he is remembered as the **“Iron Man
        of India.”** He believed in one strong and united India, and his vision
        still guides the country today.
      </p>

      <h3>A Legacy That Lives On</h3>
      <p>
        Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel passed away in **1950**, but his contribution to
        India’s unity and strength will never be forgotten. Today, the **Statue of
        Unity** in Gujarat — the tallest statue in the world — stands as a tribute
        to his greatness.
