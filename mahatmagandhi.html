    <h2>About Mahatma Gandhi</h2>
    <p>
      Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869–1948), reverently known as **Mahatma** (Great Soul) and **Father of the Nation**, was the primary leader of India's independence movement against British rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pioneered **Satyagraha** (truth force), a philosophy of non-violent resistance that inspired civil rights movements across the world, including those led by Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela.
      </p>
    <p>
      Gandhi’s methods of non-cooperation, including the **Salt March** and boycotts, mobilized millions of Indians and led to India's freedom. His ideals of peace and simple living continue to be globally relevant.

     <h3>The Birth of Mohandas</h3>
<p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on **October 2, 1869**, in Porbandar, Gujarat. His father, Karamchand Gandhi, was the Diwan (Chief Minister) of Porbandar, and his mother, Putlibai, was a deeply religious woman whose devotion to fasting and simple living greatly influenced young Mohandas. Though known for shyness in school, he was intensely committed to his beliefs.</p>

<h3>A Life-Changing Train Ride</h3>
<p>After studying law in London, Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893 to work as a legal counsel. It was here that he first faced severe racial discrimination. In a famous incident, he was forcefully removed from a first-class train compartment because he was a person of colour. This event, where he was thrown onto the cold platform, crystallized his determination to fight injustice and led him to develop the powerful tool of **Satyagraha**.</p>

<h3>Pioneering Non-Violent Resistance (Satyagraha)</h3>
<p>For over 20 years in South Africa, Gandhi perfected Satyagraha—a method of securing rights by inflicting self-suffering, without harming the oppressor. He led peaceful protests against unjust laws, organized the Indian community, and sacrificed his comfort. By the time he returned to India in 1915, he was already an experienced political leader and moral reformer.</p>

<h3>Leading India to Freedom</h3>
<p>Upon his return, Gandhi transformed the Indian National Congress and the entire freedom movement. He championed self-reliance, simple living (symbolized by his use of the **Charkha/spinning wheel**), and Hindu-Muslim unity. Major movements he led include the **Non-Cooperation Movement** (1920s), the defiance of the British tax on salt through the **Dandi March** (1930), and the **Quit India Movement** (1942). He faced repeated imprisonment but his moral authority over the masses only grew stronger.</p>

<h3>The Final Sacrifice</h3>
<p>Despite his efforts for unity, India was partitioned in 1947, leading to widespread violence. Gandhi walked through the riot-affected areas, fasting and appealing for peace, heartbroken by the communal strife. He was assassinated on **January 30, 1948**, by a Hindu extremist, Nathuram Godse. He died as he lived—a martyr to the cause of peace and truth.</p>
