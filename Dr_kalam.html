        <h3>A Humble Beginning in Rameswaram</h3>
        <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on **October 15, 1931**, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. His father, Jainulabdeen, was a boat owner, and his mother, Ashiamma, was a homemaker. His family was financially poor, and young Kalam had to **sell newspapers** after school to help support the family. This early life taught him the value of hard work and education.</p>

        <h3>The Flight That Inspired a Scientist</h3>
        <p>Kalam was an average student but had a deep curiosity for learning, especially about science and flight. A moment that changed his life forever was when his teacher, Sivasubramania Iyer, took the class to the seashore and taught them how a bird flies. This inspired him to pursue aeronautical engineering at the **Madras Institute of Technology (MIT)**.</p>

        <h3>The Missile Man of India</h3>
        <p>After graduating, Kalam joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and later the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). He was the project director for India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle (**SLV-III**), which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in orbit. His greatest contribution was leading the development of Indigenous Guided Missiles (like **Prithvi** and **Agni**), earning him the title, **"Missile Man of India."**</p>
        
        <h3>The People's President</h3>
        <p>In 2002, Dr. Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India. During his term, he became known as the **"People's President"** for his approachable nature and his deep connection with the youth. After leaving office in 2007, he returned to his true passion: teaching and writing. He believed that the youth were the greatest assets of the nation.</p>
        
        <h3>A Legacy of Inspiration</h3>
        <p>Dr. Kalam passed away on **July 27, 2015**, while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. He literally died while doing what he loved—inspiring students. His vision for India, laid out in his book **‘India 2020’**, continues to guide the nation. He remains one of India’s most revered scientists and leaders.</p>
