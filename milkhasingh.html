    <h2>About Milkha Singh</h2>
    <p>
      Milkha Singh (1929–2021), popularly known as the **"Flying Sikh,"** was one of India’s most iconic track and field athletes. His life story is a testament to perseverance, overcoming tragedy, and turning adversity into unmatched sporting glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is the only athlete to win **gold medals** at the Asian Games (four times) and the Commonwealth Games (once) in the 400-meter race. His most famous performance was finishing **fourth** in the 400m final at the **1960 Rome Olympics**, narrowly missing the bronze medal.
      </p>
    <p>
      His nickname, the 'Flying Sikh,' was given to him by the President of Pakistan, Field Marshal Ayub Khan, after he defeated Pakistan's champion runner in Lahore in 1960.

     <h3>The Scars of Partition</h3>
<p>Milkha Singh was born in 1929 in a village that is now part of Pakistan. His childhood was shattered by the violence of the **Partition in 1947**. As a teenager, he witnessed the brutal murder of his parents and several siblings. He managed to escape by hiding in a train full of refugees, eventually reaching Delhi. Orphaned and traumatized, he spent time in refugee camps, often struggling for food and survival, before his brother helped him join the Indian Army.</p>

<h3>Finding His Feet in the Army</h3>
<p>In 1953, Milkha joined the **Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering (EME)** in the Indian Army. It was here that his true potential as a runner was discovered. Though initially resistant to the strict training regimen, his natural speed was undeniable. He ran barefoot, practicing relentlessly, pushing his body past exhaustion. He famously trained until he would often vomit or collapse, driven by the desire to prove his worth and escape the poverty of his past.</p>

<h3>The Rise of a Champion</h3>
<p>Milkha Singh quickly dominated national races. His first international success came in the **1958 Asian Games**, where he won gold in both the 200m and 400m events. That same year, he won a gold medal at the **Commonwealth Games** in Cardiff, becoming the first male Indian athlete to win an individual gold medal at the Commonwealth Games.</p>

<h3>The Race of a Lifetime: Rome 1960</h3>
<p>The **1960 Rome Olympics** became the defining event of his career. He was one of the favorites for the 400m medal. In the final, he started too fast, leading for the first 200 meters. A moment of doubt, or perhaps exhaustion, caused him to slow down slightly, and he was passed by three competitors. He finished the race in **45.6 seconds**, setting a national record that stood for 38 years, but heartbreakingly, he finished in the **fourth position**, missing the bronze by just 0.1 seconds.</p>

<h3>The ‘Flying Sikh’ Title</h3>
<p>Later in 1960, Milkha Singh was invited to race in Pakistan. The race had deep emotional significance for him due to the memory of his childhood trauma. He overcame his reservations and participated, defeating Pakistan’s top runner, Abdul Khaliq. After this victory, the then-President of Pakistan, Field Marshal Ayub Khan, bestowed upon him the title, **'The Flying Sikh.'**</p>

<h3>Legacy and Inspiration</h3>
<p>Milkha Singh retired from competitive sports in 1964. His life, marked by resilience and a fighting spirit, was immortalized in his autobiography, **‘The Race of My Life’**, which later became a celebrated Bollywood film. He dedicated his later years to encouraging young athletes. Milkha Singh's journey is a powerful symbol of how dedication and courage can transform the life of an individual and inspire an entire nation.</p>
