     <h3>The Diagnosis That Changed Everything</h3>
<p>Deepa Malik’s life was forever changed in **1999** when she was diagnosed with a spinal tumour. Doctors told her that the resulting paralysis below the chest was permanent. This meant she would be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of her life. Rather than letting the diagnosis define her, Deepa decided to redefine life on her own terms. She chose to focus on what she *could* do, not what she couldn't.</p>

<h3>Finding a New Arena: Sports</h3>
<p>Deepa's journey into competitive sports began later in life. She did not start small; she first took up adventurous activities like swimming and motorcycling, even receiving a license for an adapted car. She eventually channeled her energy into athletics, specializing in the **shot put, javelin throw, and swimming**—often competing against younger athletes.</p>

<h3>A Trailblazer in Many Fields</h3>
<p>Deepa became a record-setter long before the Paralympics. She holds a world record for the longest non-stop drive by a paraplegic woman (3,000 km). She conquered the high-altitude motor rally up the Himalayas. She also proved her mettle by swimming against the strong currents of the Yamuna River for one kilometer—a feat of incredible physical and mental endurance.</p>

<h3>The Paralympic Glory (Rio 2016)</h3>
<p>Her greatest achievement came at the **2016 Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro**. Competing in the **shot put F53 event**, Deepa Malik delivered a stellar performance. She won the **Silver Medal**, making her the first Indian woman ever to win a medal at the Paralympic Games. The entire nation celebrated her victory, recognizing the decades of grit and dedication that had gone into that single throw.</p>

<h3>Legacy and Awards</h3>
<p>Deepa Malik has been honored with India's top sporting award, the **Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna** (now Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award), and the **Padma Shri**, the fourth-highest civilian award. Today, she is a leading voice for disability rights and sports inclusion in India, proving that the only limits that exist are the ones we place on ourselves. Her mantra is simple: **"Challenge the limit."**</p>
